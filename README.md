# Music Production Tools & Best Practices

>Think of sound as 3-dimensional:
>1. Height = Frequency Coverage (Timbre/Harmonics)
>2. Width = Stereo Field & Panning
>3. Depth = Volume & Ambience

# Use effects to:
* Analyze the sound
* Filter out the junk
* Balance the dynamics
* Modulate and enhance the good parts to taste

## Analyze the sound
_Figure out where, how and why it needs to sit in the mix._
* Spectrum Analyzer
* Stereo Imager
* Loudness Meter
* Oscilloscope
* Vectorscope

## Filter out the junk
_Get rid of what you don't (want to) / **can't** hear.
Control resonant peaks / unpleasant frequencies.
Allow for space for other sounds to not clutter up the mix._
* Equalizer - _controls the volume of distributed frequencies_
  * Mid EQ - _in the center of a stereo image (mono)_
  * Side EQ - _in the sides of the stereo field. eliminate phasing issues by high-passing._
* Filter - _a form of pre-set EQ with limited and more focused control_

## Balance the dynamics
_Control transients, sudden peaks and everything else to do with volume._
* Compressor - _automated volume control triggered by the volume of any frequency fed into it_
* Multiband Compressor - _automated volume control per band triggered by the volume of frequencies in that band_
* De-Esser - _eliminates the excessive prominence of sibilant consonants, such as the sounds normally represented in English by "s", "z", "ch", "j" and "sh". essentially a compressor with a band in the high region of the frequency spectrum_
* Limiter - _a compressor with an infinite ratio setting. sound cannot get louder past the set threshold/ceiling_
* Soft Clipper - _like a limiter but hard blocks sound with a softer curve minimizing distortion. peaks get rounded off instead of brick wall square-ified_
* Transient Processor - _controls the volume of transients of very short sounds like drum samples. it can compress or expand to make a drum punchier or fuller_
* Expander - _an inverse compressor. expands the volume when sound hits its set threshold._
* Noise Gate - _allows for sound to come through only if its volume surpasses the set threshold_
* Dynamic EQ - _side-chained multiband compressor_
* Volume Envelope/LFOTool - _used for sidechaining and creative purposes_

## Modulate and enhance the good parts
_Give spaciousness, brightness, interesting artifacts, harmonies, modulation and processing to sound to enhance the listener's experience._
* Delay - _give echo characteristics_
* Reverb - _simulate an ambient space_
* Distortion/Overdrive - _square-ify_
* Saturation - _introduce a subtle set of harmonics to give warmth and presence. run hot to increase perceived volume_
* Harmonizer - _generates perfect fifths_
* Exciter - _pre-set MB compressor, EQ, saturator and probably a couple of other things into one meant to brighten up your sound_
* Chorus
* Flanger
* Phaser
* Unison
* Hyper-Dimension
* Pitcher
* Pitch Shifter
* Glitcher
* Granulizer
* Bitcrusher
* Stereo Shaper/Enhancer
* Autopan
* Autofilter
* Autotune
* Vocoder
* Other/Special/Multi-FX
  * Midi (Cthulhu, Drum Sequencers)
  * Lo-Fi (Vinyl Cracklers (IZotope))
